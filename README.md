# 🌐 Cyberattack Detection & Visualization Dashboard

### 🧠 Overview
The **Cyberattack Detection & Visualization Dashboard** is an interactive 3D visualization system that simulates and displays real-time cyberattack activity across the globe. It leverages `Three.js` for 3D rendering and dynamic animation, creating an immersive world map where arcs represent attack traffic between countries.  

This project aims to visualize global network threats in a visually appealing and educational way — suitable for demonstrations, cybersecurity visualizations, or as part of a SOC (Security Operations Center) display.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize real-time or simulated cyberattacks in a **3D world map**.
- Show **source and target countries** dynamically connected by animated arcs.
- Provide a **live statistics sidebar** with top sources, logs, and prevention tips.
- Deliver a **smooth, modern, and responsive UI** optimized for performance.
- Serve as a base for integrating **real threat intelligence feeds** in the future.
