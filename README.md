# 🌐 Cyberattack Detection & Visualization Dashboard

### 🧠 Overview
The **Cyberattack Detection & Visualization Dashboard** is an interactive 3D visualization system that simulates and displays real-time cyberattack activity across the globe. It leverages `Three.js` for 3D rendering and dynamic animation, creating an immersive world map where arcs represent attack traffic between countries.  

This project aims to visualize global network threats in a visually appealing and educational way — suitable for demonstrations, cybersecurity visualizations, or as part of a SOC (Security Operations Center) display.
